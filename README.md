# Aerth
A modpack about AE2 and Thermal and using them to get off a strange, earth-like planet.\
Features Pneumaticraft and eventually Mekanism as well!\
\
Feel free to have a look around, most of the interesting stuff is in `Aerth/kubejs/`.
All the code and stuff is under MIT, so you are fairly free to go about re-using it.
