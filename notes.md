Kube Notes
==============

Waystones should be easier. Maybe balance by making sharestones early game, and waystones late game (singularity??)

Singularity should be a major crafting component - maybe an infused singularity cluster?? Melt down into gooey singularity then allow with stufff

Recipe for slime saplings.
Extract slime from slime trees using thermal gear.


~~new hotter tinkers fuel, molten fluix? made in magma crucible~~ Replaced by blitzing blood

Crystal compenents, a few new tiers.

Add info in tooltip for waystones to suggest sharestones

Inscriber requires non sticky pistons, and presses are craftable (sky stone too, blackstone). Presses maybe from amadron trading.. tho thats VERY late game. Split ae2 up into late and early game, with late game stuff requiring processors. Maybe make early game stuff require one processor type crafted in a thermal thing?

Floof crafting recipe. maybe like u grow them in vats??? idk.. also see if i can change texture to be black floofs cause those are cool.

Bottle of quantum darkness. Collected by right clicking with a bottle in the spatial dimension.

Interfaces are later game... thats right, no autocrafting till later on. Try force them to use molecular assemblers with hoppers (or importers and patterns at first. Oh yeah, disable/make later game the sequential fabricator. Still wondering about this^

## Mobs and spawning
 - All normal hostile and passive mob spawning should be disabled
 - Blizz, Basalz, Blaze and Blitz should be the only mobs spawning. They will spawn in clusters of 3-4, relatively rarely
 - Blaze and Basalz are found underground, and Blitz and Blizz are above gound (Desert and snow biomes??)


Adding mekanism for the pipes (should ideally be later game) and the reactors + induction cell.

## Singularity liquid
Singularity liquid alloys with other liquids in the smeltery (except water, thats cheating!) to make stable reactor fluid which can be used in reactors to cool them. Maybe you have to alloy it with water first, not sure.

## KUBE HUD
Music. Hopefully
WTHAISA - use an item to raytrace and tell you the block you are staring at. Cool blue holographic zoom line animation


## Story

You have crashed down on an unfamiliar earth-like planet. You do not know where, or how you came to be here. You have your spaceship, with emergency supplies and the spatial pylons. The backup boxes are still there, and there are always going to be moere hidden around the ship, you know how the ship builders did that.

There is no regular mob spawning here, all materials must be fabricted elsehow. Blizz, Basalz and co should spawn however, tho the specifcs of that I am not sure. custom Kube item with r click action? 
The only mobs that spawn are Blaze Basalz Blitz Blizz, and only rarely in small groups. 

### Ship

A few supplies left over from the crash, of which there is no remains. These include some spatial pylons, a spatial cell, a certus pick and a spatial chamber thingy.

OR:

A smallish construction, with a small item terminal system (unpowered). A small chamber in the back contains a 2x2x2 spatial chamber, which you can use to pull structures out of these strange quantum compression cells.

Maybe a tardis instead of a ship.. (no, its definetly nt casue my building skills are terrible)

# Other

## WORLD GEN
 - Respawn anchor: yes, bed: no
 - piglins are safe
 - has raids false
 - custom infiniburn tag?
 - ultrawarm false.. definitely false
 - natrual.. up for debate on this. Not sure if clocks should work.
 - Obsidian 'meteors' generating around alot


 ## Annoying mods
  - Tinkers, doesn't have config for slimes spawning on slimy grass
  - AE2, doesn't use the vanilla system for generating meteorites.

# To Do list
 - Change covered cables recipe to require at least some thermal resources. Servo Press maybe? Also think about changing fluix cable recipe.
 - Make spores craftable (re-do aquatic entangler to be spore catcher?), and add recipe for slime saplings
 - Add recipe for compressed iron that uses a tree of thermal machines. Some to make iron (From basalt, so soul soil needs to be craftable) and then some to alloy that into compressed iron. Probably air liquid will be required.
 - Work out AE2 tier tree, and adjust press recipes accordingly. Tier 1 is very beginning of thermal, tier 2 is end of thermal start of PNC, tier 3 is end of PNC and tier 4 is creative stuff and other OP things from end game mek. QIO is going to be disabled, btw
 - Add an item to capture and release elementals, preferably storing nbt in the item like health ect. This can be eventually used in PNC for some stuff. Raw essence orb maybe? Possibly even have to click it into a statue to get that to absorb the element... Simple tho. Simple
