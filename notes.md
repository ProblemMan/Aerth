__**Kube Notes**__

Waystones should be easier. Maybe balance by making sharestones early game, and waystones late game (singularity??)

Singularity should be a major crafting component - maybe an infused singularity cluster?? Melt down into gooey singularity then allow with stufff


new hotter tinkers fuel, molten fluix? made in magma crucible

liquid of smart? made of melted books


make large singularity require the centre thingy from a wireless ae2 thingo



Add info in tooltip for waystones to suggest sharestones
Machine Frame requires processors. Only the engineering one though. Servo requires calculation press.
Inscriber requires non sticky pistons, and presses are craftable (sky stone too, blackstone). 

silcon press should give a couple, or silicon recipe gives 2 silicon

diamond shards are used for engineer presses not diamonds
