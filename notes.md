__**Kube Notes**__

Waystones should be easier. Maybe balance by making sharestones early game, and waystones late game (singularity??)

Singularity should be a major crafting component - maybe an infused singularity cluster?? Melt down into gooey singularity then allow with stufff


new hotter tinkers fuel, molten fluix? made in magma crucible

liquid of smart? made of melted books


make large singularity require the centre thingy from a wireless ae2 thingo



Add info in tooltip for waystones to suggest sharestones
Machine Frame requires processors. Only the engineering one though. Servo requires calculation press.
Inscriber requires non sticky pistons, and presses are craftable (sky stone too, blackstone). 

silcon press should give a couple, or silicon recipe gives 2 silicon

diamond shards are used for engineer presses not diamonds

Bottle of quantum darkness. Collected by right clicking in the spatial dimension.

Interfaces are later game... thats right, no autocrafting till later on. Try force them to use molecular assemblers with hoppers (or importers and patterns at first. Oh yeah, disable/make later game the sequential fabricator.

**Story**

You have crashed down on an unfamiliar earth-like planet. You do not know where, or how you came to be here. You have your spaceship, with emergency supplies and the spatial pylons. The backup boxes are still there, and there are always going to be moere hidden around the ship, you know how the ship builders did that.


__Ship__

A few supplies left over from the crash, of which there is no remains. These include some spatial pylons, a spatial cell, a certus pick and a spatial chamber thingy.

OR:

A smallish construction, with a small item terminal system (unpowered). A small chamber in the back contains a 2x2x2 spatial chamber, which you can use to pull structures out of these strange quantum compression cells.
