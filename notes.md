__**Kube Notes**__

AROOGIA

Waystones should be easier. Maybe balance by making sharestones early game, and waystones late game (singularity??)

Singularity should be a major crafting component - maybe an infused singularity cluster?? Melt down into gooey singularity then allow with stufff


new hotter tinkers fuel, molten fluix? made in magma crucible

liquid of smart? made of melted books


make large singularity require the centre thingy from a wireless ae2 thingo

Gate gunpowder so its late game, hich means quantum entangled singularritys are late game as well, which is good.

Crystal compenents, a few new tiers.

Nether quartz crafted from certus 

Add info in tooltip for waystones to suggest sharestones
Machine Frame requires processors. Only the engineering one though. Servo requires calculation press.
Inscriber requires non sticky pistons, and presses are craftable (sky stone too, blackstone). 

silcon press should give a couple, or silicon recipe gives 2 silicon

diamond shards are used for engineer presses not diamonds

Bottle of quantum darkness. Collected by right clicking in the spatial dimension.

Interfaces are later game... thats right, no autocrafting till later on. Try force them to use molecular assemblers with hoppers (or importers and patterns at first. Oh yeah, disable/make later game the sequential fabricator.

**Mobs and spawning**
 - All normal hostile and passive mob spawning should be disabled
 - Blizz, Basalz, Blaze and Blitz should be the only mobs spawning. They will spawn in clusters of 3-4, relatively rarely
 - Blaze and Basalz are found underground, and Blitz and Blizz are above gound (Desert and snow biomes??)




**Story**

You have crashed down on an unfamiliar earth-like planet. You do not know where, or how you came to be here. You have your spaceship, with emergency supplies and the spatial pylons. The backup boxes are still there, and there are always going to be moere hidden around the ship, you know how the ship builders did that.

There is no regular mob spawning here, all materials must be fabricted elsehow. Blizz, Basalz and co should spawn however, tho the specifcs of that I am not sure. custom Kube item with r click action? 
The only mobs that spawn are Blaze Basalz Blitz Blizz, and only rarely in small groups. 

__Ship__

A few supplies left over from the crash, of which there is no remains. These include some spatial pylons, a spatial cell, a certus pick and a spatial chamber thingy.

OR:

A smallish construction, with a small item terminal system (unpowered). A small chamber in the back contains a 2x2x2 spatial chamber, which you can use to pull structures out of these strange quantum compression cells.

Maybe a tardis instead of a ship.. (no, its definetly nt casue my building skills are terrible)



**WORLD GEN**
 - Respawn anchor: yes, bed: no
 - piglins are safe
 - has raids false
 - custom infiniburn tag?
 - ultrawarm false.. definitely false
 - natrual.. up for debate on this. Not sure if clocks should work.
 - Obsidian 'meteors' generating around alot


 **Annoying mods**
  - Tinkers, doesn't have config for slimes spawning on slimy grass
  - AE2, doesn't use the vanilla system for generating meteorites.
